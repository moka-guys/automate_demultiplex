'''
Created on 21 Sep 2016
Once demultiplexing has been complete the files require uploading to DNANexus.
This script will be scheduled to run and identify any folders that require further processing
get_list_of_runs loops through runfolders and creates an instance of the process_runfolder class for each runfolder
The process_runfolder class creates an instance of the runfolder_object class and the quarterback module calls all other modules to assess the runfolder
if required, a Nexus project is created and shared, data uploaded and the pipelines set off as determined by the panel number encoded in the filename
