# Demultiplexing

The [demultiplex.py](../demultiplex.py) script performs demultiplexing, and also performs samplesheet validation on 
runs that have not yet been demultiplexed to act as an early warning system for samplesheet errors. It does this by 
calling the [samplesheet_validator.py](../samplesheet_validator.py) module, which makes use of the 
[seglh-naming](https://github.com/moka-guys/seglh-naming) library. 

[demultiplex.py](../demultiplex.py) collects runfolders in a given directory and runs a set of checks to determine 
whether demultiplexing is required for that runfolder.


## Protocol
The following criteria must be met:

1. The bcl2fastq logfile `bcl2fastq2_output.log` is absent (demultiplexing not yet performed). bcl2fastq stdout 
and stderr streams are written to this file.
2. Sequencing is complete (presence of `RTAComplete.txt` file created by the sequencer when sequencing is complete)
3. bcl2fastq is installed on the workstation 
4. Sampleseheet does not contain any errors that would cause demultiplexing to fail - checks are carried out by the
[samplesheet_validator.py](samplesheet_validator.py). Samplesheet must exist, be correctly named, be populated, contain 
minimum expected data headers, samplenames must only contain valid characters

If a runfolder meets these initial criteria:

* If the sequencer does not require an integrity check, it skips straight to `run_demultiplexing()`
* If the sequencer does require an integrity check the following requirements must be met for `run_demultiplexing()` to 
be called:
  1. Checksum file generated by 
  [integrity checking script](https://github.com/moka-guys/integrity_checking/blob/master/sequencer_checksum.py) 
  must be present 
  2. The run has not failed a previous integrity check performed by this script 
  3. The md5 checksums in the checksum file match. This verifies the integrity between the workstation and sequencer. 

`run_demultiplexing()` then performs demultiplexing tasks:
* Create a demultiplexing log file to prevent a simultaneous attempt on the next run of the script (bcl2fastq is slow
  to create the logfile)
* If the run is a tso run, creates a tso bcl2fastq log file but does not demultiplex 
* Otherwise, demultiplexes all other runs that get this far using bcl2fastq2 (v2.20)

If the script has processed any runfolders, it renames the logfile with the runfolder names


## Configuration

Settings are imported from [samplesheet_validator.py](../automate_demultiplex_config.py).

## Logging

| Alias | Description | Filename | Location |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
|Demultiplex Log|Records the decisions made for multiple runfolders each time the script is run|`TIMESTAMP_RUNFOLDER-NAME_demultiplex_script_log.txt`| /usr/local/src/mokaguys/automate_demultiplexing_logfiles/Demultiplexing_log_files/ |
|Bcl2fastq output| STDOUT and STDERR from bcl2fastq | `bcl2fastq2_output.log` | Within the runfolder |
|Demultiplex output| STDERR and STDOUT from demultiplexing script. Includes errors from the cronjob | `TIMESTAMP.txt` | /usr/local/src/mokaguys/automate_demultiplexing_logfiles/Demultiplexing_stdout |

## Alerts

Logs from this script containing the follow strings will trigger alerts to the #moka-alerts binfx slack channel:

* demultiplex_fail
