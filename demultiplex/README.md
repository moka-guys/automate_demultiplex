# Demultiplexing

The [demultiplex.py](../demultiplex.py) script performs the following:

1. Demultiplexing
2. Cluster density calculation

## Protocol

[demultiplex.py](../demultiplex.py) collects runfolders in the config-specified runfolders directory, and runs a set of checks to determine whether demultiplexing is required for that runfolder. The checks determine that the runfolder meets the following criteria:

1. The bcl2fastq logfile `bcl2fastq2_output.log` is absent (demultiplexing not yet performed). bcl2fastq stdout and stderr streams are written to this file
2. Sequencing is complete (presence of `RTAComplete.txt` file created by the sequencer when sequencing is complete)
3. bcl2fastq is installed on the workstation
4. Samplesheet does not contain any errors that would cause demultiplexing to fail - checks are carried out by the [samplesheet_validator.py](../samplesheet_validator/samplesheet_validator.py) module which makes use of the [seglh-naming](https://github.com/moka-guys/seglh-naming) library. The absence of error messages for specific tests is checked:
   * Sample sheet is present
   * Samplesheet name is valid (validates using the [seglh-naming](https://github.com/moka-guys/seglh-naming) library)
   * Samplesheet is not empty
   * Samplesheet contains the minimum expected `[Data]` section headers: `Sample_ID, Sample_Name, index`
   * Sample name does not contain any illegal characters (in case this was not rectified after the early warning checks as this will cause bcl2fastq to fail)

If a runfolder meets these initial criteria:

* If the sequencer does not require an integrity check, it skips straight to `run_demultiplexing()`
* If the sequencer does require an integrity check the following requirements must be met for `run_demultiplexing()` to be called:
  1. Checksum file generated by [integrity checking script
  ](https://github.com/moka-guys/integrity_checking/blob/master/sequencer_checksum.py)
must be present
  2. The run has not failed a previous integrity check performed by this script
  3. The md5 checksums in the checksum file match. This verifies the integrity between the workstation and sequencer

`run_demultiplexing()` then performs demultiplexing tasks:

* Create demultiplexing log file to prevent simultaneous attempt on the next run of the script (bcl2fastq is slow to create the logfile)
* If the run is a tso run, creates a tso bcl2fastq log file but does not demultiplex
* Otherwise, demultiplexes all other runs that get this far using `bcl2fastq2 (v2.20)`

## Usage



## Configuration

Settings are imported from [ad_config.py](../config/ad_config.py) and [panel_config.py](../config/panel_config.py).

## Logging

Logging is performed using [ad_logger](../ad_logger/ad_logger.py).

| Alias | Description | Filename | Location |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Demultiplex output | Catches any traceback from errors when running the cron job that are not caught by exception handling within the script | `TIMESTAMP.txt` | `/usr/local/src/mokaguys/automate_demultiplexing_logfiles/Demultiplexing_stdout` |
| demultiplex | Records script-level logs for the demultiplex script | `TIMESTAMP_demultiplex_script_log.log` | `/usr/local/src/mokaguys/automate_demultiplexing_logfiles/demultiplexing_script_logfiles/` |
| demultiplex | Records runfolder-level logs for the demultiplex script | `RUNFOLDERNAME_demultiplex_script_log.log` | `/usr/local/src/mokaguys/automate_demultiplexing_logfiles/demultiplexing_script_logfiles/` |
 Bcl2fastq output | STDOUT and STDERR from bcl2fastq | `bcl2fastq2_output.log` | Within the runfolder |

## Alerts

Logs from this script containing the follow strings will trigger alerts to the `moka-alerts` binfx slack channel:

* DEMUX_FAIL

## Testing

**N.B. Tests and test cases/files MUST be maintained and updated accordingly in conjunction with script development**

Test datasets are stored in [/test/data](../test/data). The script has a full test suite:
* [test_demultiplex.py](../test/test_demultiplex.py)
  
These tests should be run before pushing any code to ensure all tests in the GitHub Actions workflow pass.
